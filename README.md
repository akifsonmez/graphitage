Today, within this surplus of information, it is very easy to get lost and 
lose time and already gathered information. 
Because of poor management of information, losing track of what you already know,
your thoughts and how all this information is related to each other is not uncommon.

Think of a way that lets you store all your newly gained information to your hearts
content, see how they are connected to other information, keep notes, and share your ideas.
Graphitage does just that. 

With Graphitage, you can store the contents of any paper, see the relationship 
between stored papers via "Knowledge Graph", add your notes to these papers and share
them with others.

Graphitage, a problem solver for all the professionals among many profession groups,
allows you to easily analyze big data and see the relationships between 
them.
